<!-- 
	These plugins are used to enable the usage of the new action target frame on 
	some unit frames addons such as ShadowedUnitFrames, ElvUI and XPerl.

	These plugins hook in the inner logic of these addons to implement a new UnitFrame based on their implementation of target frame.
	Plugins can be created for AddOns that exposes their logic to the global environment. addons that does not do that will need to be
	modified.
